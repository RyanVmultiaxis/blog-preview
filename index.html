            <p>
              Manufacturing has always been driven by experience. The challenge today is not a lack of information, but the speed at which decisions need to be made.
            </p>
            <p>
              As machine tools, controls, and processes become more complex, the way we access and apply knowledge is changing just as fast.
            </p>
            <p>
              This post explores how modern manufacturing teams are adapting to that shift.

            <h2>The Challenge with Traditional Knowledge</h2>
            <p>
              Tribal knowledge has long been the backbone of machining environments. The most experienced people in the shop often hold the answers to the toughest problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              The issue arises when that knowledge is not documented, searchable, or available when it’s needed most.

          <section class="post-section">
            <h2>Why Speed Matters More Than Ever</h2>
            <p>
              Cycle times are tighter. Delivery expectations are higher. Customers expect answers immediately, not after a few phone calls and emails.
            </p>
            <p>
              Decision-making speed has become a competitive advantage in modern manufacturing environments.

            <h2>Bridging the Gap with Modern Tools</h2>
            <p>
              Digital tools now allow teams to capture experience, documentation, and best practices in a way that can be accessed instantly.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reduced troubleshooting time</li>
              <li>Faster onboarding for new team members</li>
              <li>More consistent decision-making</li>

              The goal is not to replace experience — it’s to amplify it.

            <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
            <p>
              The manufacturing teams that succeed in the coming years will be the ones who treat knowledge as a strategic asset.
            </p>
            <p>
              Those who invest early will find themselves moving faster, making better decisions, and staying ahead of the curve.
