          <div class="intro-text">
            <p><strong>AI has become one of those topics that instantly divides the room.</strong></p>

            <p>
              Some people are excited. Some are curious. Some are quietly using it every day and not talking about it. And then there are two groups that stand out the most: the people who are afraid it is going to take their job, and the people who are openly anti-AI.
            </p>

            <p>
              The surprising part is how often that second group is made up of younger professionals. People in their 20s and 30s. People who are smart, talented, and already established in their careers.
            </p>

            <p>
              I had a conversation recently with a professional in their late 20s who told me they had not really used AI because they “don’t like what it’s doing to my industry.”
            </p>

            <p>
              I understand the sentiment. But it also highlights something we need to talk about honestly. Whether you like it or not, this is happening. And the best move is not to fight it. It is to learn how to use it responsibly and use it as leverage.

            <h2>The Fear Is Not New</h2>

            <p>
              If you have been around manufacturing long enough, you have seen this pattern play out over and over again.
            </p>

            <p>
              When CAD replaced drafting tables, some people refused to touch it. When CNC began replacing manual machining, there were machinists who swore a program would never beat a handwheel. When spreadsheets and automation hit business workflows, people worried it would destroy entire professions.
            </p>

            <p>
              What actually happened was simpler. The people who adapted became more valuable. The people who did not slowly became less relevant.
            </p>

            <p>
              We spoke about this earlier last year in <a href="https://multiaxis.ai/news/060125.html" target="_blank"><strong>Productivity Is Just a Symptom</strong></a>. The core idea was not that productivity itself was the problem. It was that tools tend to expose skill gaps. The skilled become more effective. The unskilled become more dependent.
            </p>

            <p>
              AI follows the same pattern. It does not change the fundamentals. It magnifies them.

            <h2>AI Does Not Replace Skill. It Amplifies It.</h2>

            <p>
              Here is the part most people miss. AI does not create expertise. It does not replace experience. It does not magically make someone good at something they do not understand.
            </p>

            <p>
              What it does do is remove friction.
            </p>

            <p>
              A capable person using AI can move faster, explore more options, reduce repetitive work, communicate more clearly, and get to better decisions sooner. The craft still matters. Judgment still matters. Taste still matters. Domain knowledge still matters.
            </p>

            <p>
              AI does not replace the person. It amplifies the person.

            <h2>A Simple Analogy</h2>

            <p>
              Let us pull this out of the tech world for a second.
            </p>

            <p>
              Say you need repairs done on your house, and you need them done quickly. You have two contractors:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>An old-school carpenter who refuses to use power tools and insists on hammering in every nail by hand.</li>
              <li>An equally skilled carpenter who uses modern tools, nail guns, laser levels, cordless saws, and finishes the job faster with the same craftsmanship.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Neither contractor lacks skill. The difference is leverage.
            </p>

            <p>
              AI is the power tool.
            </p>
          </section>

          <!-- Highlight -->
          <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>
              AI is not the threat. The threat is pretending it is not happening.
            </p>
          </div>

          <section class="post-section">
            <h2>The Stigma Needs to Go Away</h2>

            <p>
              Two years ago, I was talking with a high-level professional in their mid-50s who needed to put together a presentation for their boss. They told me they were nervous and said, “I failed English class in school and I am bad at it.”
            </p>

            <p>
              I showed them how to use AI to re-word their own thoughts so they sounded clearer and more professional. The ideas were still theirs. The intent was still theirs. The tool simply helped remove friction.
            </p>

            <p>
              We were standing in a machine shop at the time, and I was speaking loudly. They stopped me and said, “Keep it down. My boss is right over there.”
            </p>

            <p>
              They were not worried about the content. They were worried about the stigma.

          <section class="post-section">
            <h2>Clear Communication Is a Competitive Advantage</h2>

            <p>
              If you are communicating with customers, leadership, or stakeholders where clarity really matters, using tools that help you communicate better should be encouraged, not hidden.
            </p>

            <p>
              You still proofread. You still own the message. You still make sure it reflects your intent.
            </p>

            <p>
              Refusing to use AI for communication today is no different than refusing to use spellcheck, refusing to use calculators, or refusing to use power tools because you want to prove you can do it the hard way.

            <h2>The Real Risk Is Being Outpaced</h2>

            <p>
              AI adoption is not going to be optional long-term.
            </p>

            <p>
              This does not mean jobs disappear overnight. It means expectations shift. Speed becomes the baseline. Efficiency becomes assumed.
            </p>

            <p>
              When two people are equally talented, the one who can research faster, iterate faster, and communicate clearer tends to get the opportunity.
            </p>

            <p>
              Not because they replaced someone. Because they kept up.

            <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

            <p>
              AI is not here to take your job. But it is changing how work gets done.
            </p>

            <p>
              The people who thrive will not be the loudest advocates or the harshest critics. They will be the ones who quietly integrate these tools into their workflow and raise the quality of their output.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is not about replacement.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is about leverage.
