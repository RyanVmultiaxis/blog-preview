          <div class="intro-text">
            <p><strong>AI has become one of those topics that instantly divides the room.</strong></p>
            <p>
              Some people are excited. Some are curious. Some are quietly using it every day and not talking about it. And then there are two groups that stand out the most: the people who are afraid it’s going to take their job, and the people who are openly “anti-AI.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The surprising part is how often that second group is made up of younger professionals. People in their 20s and 30s. People who are smart, talented, and already established in their careers.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had a conversation recently with a 27-year-old marketing professional who told me she hadn’t really used AI because she “doesn’t like what it’s doing to her industry.”
            </p>
            <p>
              I understand the sentiment. I really do. But it also highlights something we need to talk about honestly: whether you like it or not, this is happening. And the best move isn’t to fight it. It’s to learn how to use it responsibly — and use it as leverage.
            </p>

            <h2>The Fear Isn’t New</h2>
            <p>
              If you’ve been around manufacturing long enough, you’ve seen this pattern play out over and over again.
            </p>
            <p>
              When CAD replaced drafting tables, some people refused to touch it. When CNC began replacing manual machining, there were machinists who swore a program would never beat a handwheel. When spreadsheets and automation hit business workflows, people worried it would destroy entire professions.
            </p>
            <p>
              What actually happened was simpler: the people who adapted became more valuable. The people who didn’t… slowly became less relevant.
            </p>
            <p>
              AI is not a new story. It’s the same story, just louder.

            <h2>AI Doesn’t Replace Skill. It Amplifies It.</h2>
            <p>
              Here’s the part most people miss: AI doesn’t create expertise. It doesn’t replace experience. It doesn’t magically make someone “good” at something they don’t understand.
            </p>
            <p>
              What it does do is remove friction.
            </p>
            <p>
              A capable person using AI can move faster, explore more options, reduce repetitive work, communicate more clearly, and get to better decisions sooner. The craft still matters. Judgment still matters. Taste still matters. Domain knowledge still matters.
            </p>
            <p>
              AI doesn’t replace the person. It amplifies the person.

            <h2>A Simple Analogy</h2>
            <p>
              Let’s pull this out of the tech world for a second.
            </p>
            <p>
              Say you need repairs done on your house, and you need them done quickly. You have two contractors:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>An old-school carpenter who refuses to use power tools and insists on hammering in every nail by hand.</li>
              <li>An equally skilled carpenter who uses modern tools — nail guns, laser levels, cordless saws — and finishes the job faster with the same craftsmanship.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Neither carpenter lacks skill. The difference is leverage.
            </p>
            <p>
              AI is the power tool.
            </p>
          </section>

          <!-- Section -->
          <section class="post-section">
            <h2>“Anti-AI” Is Really “Anti-Change”</h2>
            <p>
              When someone says they’re “anti-AI,” what they usually mean is one of these:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>They’ve seen it used in a lazy way, and they don’t respect the output.</li>
              <li>They’re worried it will reduce the value of their work.</li>
              <li>They don’t want to be forced to learn something new.</li>
              <li>They’re frustrated by how fast it’s moving.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Those are fair concerns. AI can absolutely be misused. It can flood industries with low-effort content. It can encourage shortcuts. It can be weaponized by people who don’t care about quality.
            </p>
            <p>
              But that doesn’t change the direction of the world. It changes the responsibility of the professionals inside it.
            </p>

          <!-- Highlight Callout -->
          <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>
              AI is not the threat. The threat is pretending it isn’t happening.

          </div>

          <section class="post-section">
            <h2>The Real Risk: Being Outpaced</h2>
            <p>
              Here’s the uncomfortable truth: AI adoption isn’t going to be “optional” for most industries long-term.
            </p>
            <p>
              This doesn’t mean your job disappears overnight. It means the baseline shifts. It means speed and efficiency become expected. It means output increases. And it means people who leverage AI will often be able to do more in less time — while maintaining quality.
            </p>
            <p>
              When two people are equally talented, the one who can research faster, iterate faster, communicate clearer, and respond quicker tends to get the opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not because they replaced someone. Because they kept up.

            <h2>What AI Is Actually Great For</h2>
            <p>
              AI shines in the areas most people don’t love anyway — the busywork and the friction.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Turning scattered notes into clean structure</li>
              <li>Summarizing long documents</li>
              <li>Generating first drafts to react to</li>
              <li>Brainstorming alternatives when you’re stuck</li>
              <li>Helping you communicate clearer and faster</li>
              <li>Reducing “blank page” time</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              And here’s the key point: none of that removes the need for a skilled professional. It simply frees them up to spend more time where their value is highest.

            <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
            <p>
              AI isn’t here to take your job. But it is absolutely changing how work gets done.
            </p>
            <p>
              The people who thrive won’t be the loudest advocates or the harshest critics. They’ll be the ones who quietly integrate these tools into their workflow, improve their efficiency, raise the quality of their output, and keep their standards high.
            </p>
            <p>
              Just like every major shift before it, this isn’t about replacement.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s about leverage.
